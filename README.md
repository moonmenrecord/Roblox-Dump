# Roblox-Dump
This is to extract and find some stuff. Every so and then (When ROBLOX gets updated) I try to add the new stuff I find. I also add origins of icons and stuff.

#ReflectionMetadata.xml
ReflectionMetadata.xml is a basically a XML Spreadsheet full of assets. You will need this. Dont delete anything important listed here.
